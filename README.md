# ⚠️ Notes

## This project only allows **new** resources, not **delete** resources!

### Example

- Use the CDN address of the npm package:
```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/[project]@[version][path][file]
```
- Use static resources from the GitHub repository:
```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zkdex-perpetual/static@0.0.1/styles/reset.css
```

> **Important**: Do not easily delete the released version resources (Releases).
